<h1>FullStack TodoList App</h1>

This is a fullstack todo list application in which users can register, sign in and submit simple todo's into their personal lists. This is ment to be a simple project with the personal goal of learn Google's Firebase Cloud services (Firestore Database & User Authentication) alongside recent tailwind features. I do plan to add the possibility for users to create multiple lists and archive them in the future.
<h3>This project covers</h3>
<ul>
<li>CRUD operations using Google's Firestore</li>
<li>User Authentication</li>
<li>Use of additional Google's Firebase APIs</li>
<li>Use of localStorage to save user preferences</li>
</ul>
